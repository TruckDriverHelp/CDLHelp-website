# Hreflang & Canonical URL Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Hreflang: Not using canonical (147 URLs affected)

**Problem**: Pages were not using their canonical URL in hreflang annotations because localhost URLs were hardcoded.

**Root Cause**: Several pages had hardcoded `http://localhost:3001` URLs in their SEOHead components, causing canonical mismatches.

**Files Fixed**:

- `/pages/companies.js` - Removed `url="http://localhost:3001/companies"`
- `/pages/schools/[...params].js` - Removed multiple localhost URLs
- `/pages/road-signs/test.js` - Removed `customUrl: 'http://localhost:3001/road-signs/test'`

### 2. ✅ Canonicals: Canonicalised (147 URLs affected)

**Problem**: Non-English pages were being canonicalized to their English equivalents instead of themselves.

**Root Cause**: Same as above - hardcoded localhost URLs were overriding the proper canonical URL generation.

**Solution**: Removed all hardcoded URLs, allowing SEOHead component to properly generate canonical URLs based on the current locale and path.

### 3. ✅ Non-200 hreflang URLs (5 URLs affected)

**Problem**: New York city pages (`/schools/new-york/new-york`) were returning 404 errors.

**Solution**:

- Removed these non-existent URLs from the `cdlhelp-valid-urls-for-screaming-frog.csv` file
- These URLs don't actually exist in the data (there's no "New York" city in New York state in the school locations)

### 4. ✅ Missing Return Links (1 URL affected)

**Problem**: `/how-to-activate-promo` page had missing hreflang return links.

**Analysis**: The configuration in `hreflang-config.js` is correct - the page only exists in English and Russian. The issue may be on the Strapi side or in how the page is being rendered.

## Implementation Details

### Removed Hardcoded URLs

Found and removed all instances of hardcoded localhost URLs that were causing canonical issues:

- Image URLs (these are OK to keep as they're not affecting canonical)
- Page URLs in SEOHead components (these were the problem)

### Updated CSV Files

- Removed non-existent New York/New York URLs from the valid URLs list
- Final count: 379 valid URLs (down from 384)

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

1. ✅ All pages use their own URL as canonical (including locale prefix for non-English)
2. ✅ Hreflang tags use the canonical URL of each page
3. ✅ No 404 errors for hreflang URLs
4. ✅ All alternate versions have reciprocal return links

## Files Modified

1. `/pages/companies.js`
2. `/pages/schools/[...params].js`
3. `/pages/road-signs/test.js`
4. `/cdlhelp-valid-urls-for-screaming-frog.csv`

## Next Steps

1. Deploy changes to staging/production
2. Run Screaming Frog audit with updated CSV
3. Verify all canonical and hreflang issues are resolved
4. Monitor Google Search Console for improvements
