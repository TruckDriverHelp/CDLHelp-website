# Tawk.to Integration Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/pages/_app.js`

- Removed the TawkTo component import: `const TawkTo = lazy(() => import("../components/_App/TawkTo.js"));`
- Removed the TawkTo component rendering block:
  ```jsx
  {
    /* Tawk.to - Load on user interaction */
  }
  <Suspense fallback={null}>
    <TawkTo />
  </Suspense>;
  ```

### 2. Modified `/components/_App/TawkTo.js`

- Replaced the entire file content with a deletion notice
- The file originally contained the Tawk.to integration code that loaded the chat widget on user interaction

## To Complete the Removal

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Delete the TawkTo.js file completely
rm components/_App/TawkTo.js

# Remove the deletion marker file if it exists
rm components/_App/TawkTo.js.delete

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Remove Tawk.to integration

- Removed TawkTo component from _app.js
- Deleted TawkTo.js component file
- Removed lazy loading of Tawk.to chat widget"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```

## Impact

- The Tawk.to chat widget will no longer appear on the website

- No other functionality is affected
